to know anything about Spanish in order to play it.

The game was built on C++ and should run on any windows machine.

If you want to play the game:
    +Run         ./WinMine_CAFESANU_Code_1.0/WinMineCAFESANU.exe

If you want to actually install the game
    +Run         ./WinMine_CAFESANU_Installer/WMC.exe
